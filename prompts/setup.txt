You are creating a VERY beginner-friendly FastAPI project for someone who knows:
- basic Python (variables, lists, dicts, functions)
- basic classes (__init__, attributes, methods)
- basic shell usage
- NO web programming concepts

GOALS:
- Treat FastAPI like "Python functions exposed to the browser"
- Reinforce basic object-oriented programming using simple custom classes
- Avoid async, databases, ORMs, authentication, or frontend frameworks
- Use only in-memory Python data structures
- Keep everything simple, explicit, and readable

PROJECT NAME:
task_api

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
task_api/
├── main.py
└── README.md

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use FastAPI
- Use uvicorn to run the server
- No extra dependencies beyond fastapi and uvicorn
- Python 3.10+

CORE DATA MODEL:
- Create a custom Python class `Task`
- `Task` should have:
  - attributes: id (int), title (str), done (bool)
  - __init__ method
  - a method `to_dict()` that returns a dict representation

- Store tasks in a list called `tasks` containing `Task` objects

FUNCTIONALITY TO IMPLEMENT:

1) Root endpoint
- GET /
- Returns JSON: {"message": "Hello from FastAPI"}

2) View all tasks
- GET /tasks
- Returns {"tasks": [task.to_dict() for task in tasks]}

3) Add a task
- POST /tasks
- Accepts a query parameter `title: str`
- Creates a new Task:
  - id = len(tasks) + 1
  - done = False
- Appends it to the list
- Returns the created task as dict

4) Mark task as done
- POST /tasks/{task_id}/done
- Finds the Task by id
- Sets done = True
- Returns the updated task as dict
- If not found, return {"error": "Task not found"}

STYLE RULES:
- Use synchronous functions (def, not async def)
- Use exactly one custom class (Task)
- No Pydantic models
- No dataclasses
- No inheritance
- Keep logic simple and readable
- Avoid clever Python tricks or abstractions

README.md REQUIREMENTS:
- Explain what the project is in plain English
- Explain what an API is using simple language
- Explain the Task class and why it exists
- Explain how to run the server step by step
- Show the exact uvicorn command
- Explain how to test endpoints using:
  - the browser
  - /docs (Swagger UI)
- Explain the mental model:
  "Python function → URL → JSON response"

OUTPUT:
- Create all files
- Include full code for main.py
- Include a complete README.md
- Do NOT add extra features beyond what is specified
